## Quiz1

## swap case of characters in a string.

This is a simple quiz application that demonstrates how to swap the case of each character in a string in JavaScript.

### DESCRIPTION.

The prompt-sync package is required to create a synchronous prompt for user input.

The swapCase function is defined, which takes a string as an argument.

Inside the swapCase function, the input string is split into an array of characters using the split("") method.

The map() method is called on the array of characters to create a new array where each character is transformed based on the specified callback function.

The callback function checks if the lowercase version of the character is equal to the character itself. If it is, that means the character is already lowercase, so it returns the uppercase version of the character. Otherwise, it returns the lowercase version of the character.

The new array of transformed characters is joined back into a string using the join("") method.

Finally, the input string is logged to the console, and the swapCase function is called on the input string and the result is logged to the console as well.

## Quiz2

## Generating an array of numbers between two values.

This is a simple quiz application that demonstrates how to generate an array of numbers based on a given start and end value.

### Description

The prompt-sync package is required to create a synchronous prompt for user input.

The generateArray function is defined, which takes a start value and an end value as arguments.

Inside the generateArray function, an empty array arr is created.

A for loop is used to iterate from the start value to the end value, incrementing the loop variable i by 1 on each iteration.

On each iteration, the current value of i is pushed to the arr array.

Finally, the arr array is returned.

## Quiz3

## Finding prime numbers in an array efficiently.

This is a simple quiz application that demonstrates various operations on arrays such as addition, removal, and updating elements.

### Description

The prompt-sync package is required to create a synchronous prompt for user input.

The following functions are defined in this project:

addToArray:

This function takes an array and an element as arguments and adds the element to the array using the push() method.

removeFromArray:

This function takes an array and an element as arguments and removes the element from the array using the splice() method.

updateElement:

This function takes an array, an index, and a new value as arguments and updates the element at the specified index with the new value.
printArray: This function takes an array as an argument and logs the array to the console.
